### ***The essence of the game***
***
**tagline:**
Come find the lost treasure and learn to know a special world.
<br />

**Elevator speech:**

The game "Special World" is a unique adventure game which is suitable for people who want to learn about 8 different types of disabilities. This game will raise awareness about this topic among the players who will play it.
Unlike games that deal with a specific disability, here will be an overview of 8 types of disabilities within one game!
This is a different game content and experience from the rest of the games, which will make people attracted to the game.

**Platform:** PC <br />

**Who the game is for:** <br />
The game is for single player.
The game is intended for people of all ages who like the genre of adventure games and the feeling of "open world" in the game. The game does not require special talent and prior knowledge.
The skills that the player will need to play the game are:
1. Ability to self-learn and rapid absorption in tasks that will require him to learn new things.
2. Patience because the player will have to look for the part on the map within the city.
<br />

 * **The core process of the game -**
     The player will move between cities when his main process will be to collect the missing piece on the map belonging to that city.

      **Controls that the player will use:** <br />
      During the missions the player will use the mouse and keyboard and sometimes also the camera

 * **The process of finishing the game -**
     Once the map is complete the player will be able to move to another city where we will combine all the people with the various disabilities the player saw in the game 
     and of course people without disabilities. If the player succeeds in completing the last mission he will get the lost treasure and the player will win the game. <br />

------
 * **An essential object for achieving the goals (main quest object)?**
     The pieces of the map that the player must collect <br />
 * **Non-essential but helpful player (resource)?**
     The objects are resources that will help him overcome the various obstacles in this city or they will help him perform the various tasks.
     The player will roam around the city and there he will find the resources. The resources will be located in hidden places around the city.
     The game will not let the player know where the resources are located and if he finds them he will win something that will make him feel happy and satisfied and lucky. 
     The resources are not really needed but only extra. The player knew how many resources are available to him by his travel backpack that will be displayed on the screen from      the bottom right. <br />
 * **A neutral object?**
     The people who live in the city.
 * **An object that bothers the player (obstacle)?**
 The player will encounter obstacles only during missions. The objects will change depending on the task.

**4. What are the options?** <br />

------
 * **What levels of difficulty will there be in the game? What will be the differences between different difficulty levels?**
     In our game there are no levels and each task will be on its own.

 * **What types of players will be in the game?**
     * **The artist:** will be reflected in the volunteer assignments.
     * **The Explorer:** Will be reflected in the player's ability to roam the city.
     * **Collector:** Will be reflected in the player's ability to gather resources.
     * **The builder:** will be reflected in the volunteer assignments.
     * **Competitive:** There will be "Hall of Fame" tables and this will be reflected in the following:
         Each player will be measured a total time of the missions in the city and according to this will be ranked in the "Hall of Fame" of the city.

 * **What options will the external features of the game have? (Brightness, sound, etc.)** <br />
     Some missions will have background music
 
 **5. What is the world?** <br />
 
------
  * **Will the world be closed or open? Round or flat?**
    The world will be closed but it instilled a sense of open world.
  
  * **Are the laws of physics, nature, geography, history, economics, society and politics in your world?**
      All the laws of nature will be the same as the laws of nature in the real world.
      In terms of geography the amount of cities that will be in the world will be as the amount of disabilities that the game will focus on.
      In terms of economics, there will be no money and trade but there will be the resources that the player finds in the world in order to make it easier for him to 
      get through missions.
      Society will be a more egalitarian society than in the real world.
  
   * **What rules will limit the player's actions in the game?**
   * The player cannot move between cities if he has failed the mission of the current city in which he is located.
   
 **6. What's the story?**
 
------
  * **What is the background story of the game - what happened before the game started?**
      The plot is based on finding a lost treasure, when an evil character cuts a map into 8 parts and each part of the map is hidden in a different city. 
      The player will enter the plot as a character whose goal is to find the 8 pieces to put together the complete map and find the lost treasure.
  
  * **What is the plot of the game - what happens during the game and how does the player affect the plot?**
      During the plot of the game the player can perform volunteer tasks.
      Example of volunteering: If the player arrives at a neglected school and is given the opportunity to arrange and reshape it, if he decides to do so we will bring him all         the resources he needs for this he will not have to look for them.
      The player's behavior will actually determine at what pace the plot will develop. He may move between cities very quickly because he will not do volunteer tasks 
      and look for fewer resources, or he will be able to roam around the city a lot looking for resources and doing volunteer tasks other than the mandatory tasks.

 **7. Who are the characters?**
 
------
  * **What are their features, what is their role in the game, and what will they look like?**

  * **Key characters - who will be the "hero" and who is the main "opponent"?**
  The "hero" will be the player, the main opponent will appear in the background story but will not actively appear during the game.
  
  * **Secondary characters - who will they be, and what will each one add to the player experience?**
      The secondary characters will have the various disabilities that will be the residents of the city (it should be noted that ordinary people will also live there and 
      the player will see an integrated and equal society). These characters will add to the player's experience the feeling of mutual guarantee when there are tasks that 
      the player will need the help of these characters in order to succeed in the mission or share in tasks in which he interacts with them. In addition, they will 
      contribute to the player's experience by evoking the emotions like: Feelings of partnership, connection and friendship with people with disabilities, giving.
  
  
### ***Stages in the game***
***
Our "stages" are basically the cities, below are the 4 missions in each city.
The difference between the cities is the population with disabilities that will be integrated together with the regular population, in each city there will be only one disability and people without disabilities.
Except for the incinerator where the player will find the treasure in which everyone will be integrated into the population.

  * **First city:**
  In a city characterized by deafness and hard of hearing the player will have to learn a simple and everyday sentence in sign language and after he has managed to learn it he     will get the following hint.
  For us to know that he managed to do the sentence well his camera will be open and he will do the movement and with the help of image processing we can tell if 
  he did them  well.
  
  * **Second city:**
  In the city of the blind and visually impaired the player will reach a very large maze from which he has to get out, but he will not be able to get out because he 
  sees but because the character will be joined by a dog who will lead the player and warn him of mines.
  This stage will be darkened a bit but just for the sake of illustration, the player will still see.
  
  * **Third city:**
      In a city characterized by paraplegia, the player will reach a racetrack and will have to win the competition. The player will of course get the customized wheelchair and       will have to figure out how to overcome the experienced people.
      Note that this really does exist in reality: racing chairs are chairs with a unique chassis and three wheels. The grip rims on the large wheels are smaller than usual rims       and their function is not to spare the user contact with the tire, but to allow him to grip them and the tire alternately and thus create a kind of two-speed drive system.       The large wheel planes are not vertical to the floor.
  * **Fourth city:**
     In a city characterized by dementia the player will have to get to a certain place within a few minutes he will have to follow a route on the map and if he does not have        enough time (he will have a timer clock that will measure how much time he has) then the world will turn
     And another route will be marked on the map.
     This task demonstrates how people with dementia feel they are forgetting how to get to a particular place.
  
  
### ***Market Survey***
***

**1.Ultima IV - Quest of the Avatar:**

The game tells the story of Daemons, dragons, and long-dead wizards still plague the countryside and must be destroyed. The seeker on the path of the Avatar will face hostile groups composed of mixed enemy types and will survive such encounters only by strategic use of weapons and terrain.
It is also an adventure game where the main player moves between cities where he has to do missions to reach the ultimate goal. In our game there will be no imaginary creatures.
But in our game the missions that a player will do will be related to a certain disability and the population in each city will vary according to the disability of the stage.
Our advantage over this game is that in our game we give players added value. <br />

**2. See No Evil:**

It is a dark, isometric puzzle game that deals with voice manipulations that simulate the behavior of the blind. A difficult fantasy in which the willingly blind are afraid of <br />
what they do not understand and are hostile to the nonconformist who opposes the rules of society (the main character). Sometimes the world seems darker with eyes open. <br />
The actor plays a character who begins as blind and during the game becomes a seer and aims to understand what has darkened her world, the character is guided by a diary she  found in prison from which she must be released, all through the voice manipulations returned objects and played proactively by the character. <br />
The game deals only with blindness while our game deals with exposing the player to some disabilities. <br />
The approaches of the two games to displaying disabilities are different but for the same purpose: raising awareness about people with disabilities. <br />
We think our game will be more understandable to children because of its simpler background story, which is an advantage for attracting a larger audience. <br />

**3. Auti-Sim:**

Auti-Sim attempts to simulate the experience of a child with autism, presenting an experience of auditory hypersensitivity on a school playground. The idea is quite simple: the player walks around a school playground, full of talking children. As they approach the children, the noise level increases, creating a total static of visual blur and audio distortion. This mechanic assaults the player at a primary level, and makes it quite difficult to stay around the other children for any extended period of time.
As a result, the player spends most of their time at the edges of the playground, isolated from the rest of the world. The silence then becomes as powerful as the sound.
In our game the player will be healthy but he will learn about different disabilities during the game by watching them and interacting with people with disabilities.
The approaches of the two games to displaying disabilities are different but for the same purpose: raising awareness about people with disabilities.
While in our game the player will discover some different disabilities in this game the player experiences only one disability.
In our opinion, our game has the advantage of attracting a target audience that connects to the subject over the second game, because our game is also combined with the plot of an adventure game, and we think children and adults are more likely to want to play it. <br />
