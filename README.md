### Building the world:
We built the building with the tools: ProBuilder and ProGrids. <br />
We designed the building using Asset from the Unity asset store. <br />
We used a player from the code [here](https://github.com/gamedev-at-ariel/06-3d-terrain-ai). <br />
In order for there to be boundaries temporarily we added mountains on top of the Terrain.
